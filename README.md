This project was completed as part of Cook System's FastTrack program. With this application, users can either "inspect" or "duel" GitHub users (AKA "devs"), viewing their properties and determining a winner by comparing number of stars, followers, and/or repositories.

To start with, I was provided an empty React project and a pre-built Express server/API, which interfaced with the GitHub API to provide useful information for the purpose of comparing devs (total number of stars, "titles", favorite languages, etc).

After completing the project, I decided to convert it to a Next.js application so it could be hosted more easily (and cheaply), via Vercel. With some changes, I was able to rebuild both the API and the client within the framework and deploy it successfully. <a href="https://dev-duel.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Now you can try it out for yourself!</a>
